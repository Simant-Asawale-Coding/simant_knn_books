The app allows the user to check whether a book will be a bestseller or not depending upon certain input.
The input includes the average rating, number of pages, ratings count, text review count, author, language, publisher & the year the book is published in.
Depending upon all of the above, the app will return a result with a probability % of the book being a bestseller.
